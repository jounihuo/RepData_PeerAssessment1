#Introduction

This is an R Markdown document for an assigment in Reproducible Research course on Coursera by Jouni Huopana. R code below provides answers to the questions presented in the assignment.

###Loading data
Data is loaded into R from the provided CSV file.
```{r}
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
data$date<-as.Date(data$date)
head(data)
```
You might need to set the locales to English to handle the dates correctly
```{r}
Sys.setlocale("LC_ALL","English")
````
###What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

To handle provided dates as separate, *unique* is used to separate unique dates.
```{r}
days<-unique(data$date)
```
Then the number of steps is extracted from the data corresponding to individual days.
```{r}
steps <- integer(0)
for(i in 1:length(days)){
  steps[i]<-sum(data$steps[data$date==days[i]])
}
```
Histogram shows the number of steps.
```{r}
hist(steps, breaks=15, main="Number of steps per day")
```
Mean and meadian is calculated
```{r}
mean(steps, na.rm=TRUE)
median(steps, na.rm=TRUE)
```
Unique minute intervals are extracted from the data
```{r}
x_interval<-unique(data$interval)
```
And a mean is calculated for each interval
```{r}
y_mean <- numeric(0)
for(i in 1:length(x_interval)){
  y_mean[i]<-mean(data$steps[data$interval==x_interval[i]], na.rm=TRUE)
}
```
###What is the average daily activity pattern?
Average step count is the plotted for the intervals.
```{r}
plot(x_interval,y_mean,type="l",xlab="5-minute intervals", ylab="Average steps taken")
```

###Inputing missing values
Numbers of rows with NAs is calculated
```{r}
nonas<-sum(complete.cases(data)==FALSE)
```
New data is created and NAs are replaced by rounded mean value for each interval
```{r}
new_data<-data
for(i in 1:nrow(data)){
  if(anyNA(new_data[i,])){
    new_data$steps[i] <- round(y_mean[new_data$interval[1]==x_interval])
  }
}
```
###Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
Calculating new mean and median values.

```{r}
new_steps <- integer(0)
for(i in 1:length(days)){
  new_steps[i]<-sum(new_data$steps[new_data$date==days[i]])
}
```

Plotting the new histogram.
```{r}
hist(new_steps, breaks=15, main="Number of steps per day")
```

The mean and median have gone down from the earlier results. This due to increase in small values.

```{r}
mean(new_steps, na.rm=TRUE)
median(new_steps, na.rm=TRUE)
```

###Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
Adding new column to the data.

```{r}
new_data$weekday <- weekdays(new_data$date)
```

Creating a weekend/weekday column.

```{r}
sun<-new_data$weekday == "Sunday"
sat<-new_data$weekday == "Saturday"
weekend <- sat | sun
new_data$week <- weekdays(new_data$date)
new_data$week[weekend]<-"weekend"
new_data$week[weekend==FALSE]<-"weekday"
```

Creating a new data set that has mean values for each interval for both weekday and weekend factors.  
```{r}
mean_week    <- tapply(new_data$steps[weekend==FALSE], new_data$interval[weekend==FALSE], mean)
mean_weekend <- tapply(new_data$steps[weekend==TRUE], new_data$interval[weekend==TRUE], mean)

weekData <- data.frame(interval = c(unique(new_data$interval),unique(new_data$interval)),
                       steps    = as.vector(c(mean_week,mean_weekend)),
                       weekend  = c(rep("weekday",length(unique(new_data$interval))),
                                    rep("weekend",length(unique(new_data$interval)))))
head(weekData)
```

Plotting the panel plot to show differens in average steps taken during weekdays and weekend.

```{r}
library("lattice")
xyplot(steps ~ interval | weekend, data = weekData,layout = c(1, 2),type='l',xlab="5-minute intervals", ylab="Average steps taken")
```
